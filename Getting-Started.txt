KQL 101 (Kusto query Language)

Employees | take 10  

Employees | count

Employees | where name has "Linda"  Employees | where name contains "Linda"

"contains" is more performance intensive than "has"
"has" does not find strings if they are a prefix of longer terms and it depends on the surrounding of the searched string.
Long story short, use "contains" if "has" does not respond.

Employees | where name == "Linda Holbert"        # Specific Match

Email 
| where sender has "envolvelabs"
| distinct sender
| count

let linda_ips = Employees
| where name has "Linda"
| distinct ip_addr;
OutboundBrowsing
| where src_ip in (linda_ips)         # Let operator
